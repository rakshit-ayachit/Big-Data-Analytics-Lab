Apache Spark is an open-source distributed computing system.
It provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.
Spark is designed to cover a wide range of workloads, from batch processing to iterative algorithms and interactive queries.
It can be deployed on various cluster management systems, including Apache Hadoop, Kubernetes, and Apache Mesos.
Spark supports multiple programming languages, including Python, Java, Scala, and R.
RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) are the primary data abstraction in Spark, representing immutable, distributed collections of objects.
Spark offers a rich set of transformations and actions for working with RDDs, enabling users to perform complex data processing tasks efficiently.
The Spark ecosystem includes libraries like Spark SQL, MLlib (Machine Learning Library), GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming for real-time data processing.
Spark has gained widespread adoption in industries such as finance, healthcare, e-commerce, and telecommunications, due to its scalability, performance, and ease of use.
